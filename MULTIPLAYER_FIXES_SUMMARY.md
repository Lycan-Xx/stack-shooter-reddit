## How Multiplayer Works Now

### Joining a Match
1. Click "Multiplayer" button
2. Wait for another player (shows "Waiting...")
3. When 2+ players join, 15-second countdown starts
4. Match begins after countdown

### During Match
- 5-minute timer
- Server handles all combat
- Die → 3s respawn cooldown
- Respawn with 2s invincibility
- No waves (server spawns vampires)
- No upgrades (multiplayer mode)

### Match End
- Winner announced (highest score)
- All player scores shown
- Your overall stats displayed
- Options: Play Again or Main Menu

## Testing Instructions

### Test Matchmaking Fix

npm run dev
```

1. Open playtest URL in Browser 1
2. Click "Multiplayer" → Should see "Waiting for players..."
3. Open same URL in Browser 2
4. Click "Multiplayer" → Countdown should start
5. Wait 15 seconds → Match begins

### Test Respawn Fix
1. Join multiplayer match
2. Let vampires kill you
3. Should see respawn timer (NOT game over)
4. After 3 seconds, respawn with shield icon
5. Shield lasts 2 seconds

### Test Stats Display
1. Complete a multiplayer match
2. Match end screen should show:
   - Winner
   - All player scores
   - Your total wins/K/D/matches
3. Return to main menu
4. Quick stats should show on start screen
