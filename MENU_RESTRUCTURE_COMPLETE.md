# Menu Restructure & Nightmare Difficulty Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Nightmare Difficulty Not Accessible ✅
**Problem**: Clicking nightmare difficulty would cause the game to crash immediately.

**Root Cause**: The `nightmare` difficulty was missing from the `DIFFICULTY` object in `src/client/lib/difficulty.js`.

**Fix**: Added complete nightmare difficulty configuration:
```javascript
nightmare: {
  playerHealth: 50,        // Half of normal
  playerSpeed: 4.5,        // Slower movement
  playerDamage: 35,        // Lower damage
  enemyHealth: 200,        // 2x normal health
  enemySpeed: 1.5,         // 50% faster
  enemyDamage: 30,         // 2x normal damage
  enemiesPerWave: 10,      // 2x normal count
  fireRate: 400,           // Slower fire rate
  dashCooldown: 6000,      // Longer cooldown
  scoreMultiplier: 10,     // 10x score reward
}
```

**File**: `src/client/lib/difficulty.js`

### 2. Main Menu Restructured ✅
**Problem**: Main menu was cluttered with difficulty buttons mixed with game modes, making navigation confusing.

**Solution**: Implemented a cleaner, more intuitive menu flow.

## New Menu Structure

### **Main Menu** (Start Screen)

## User Flow

### Before (Confusing):
```
Main Menu
├── Daily Challenge button
├── Tutorial button
├── Squads button
├── Leaderboards button
├── Easy button
├── Normal button
├── Hard button
└── Nightmare button (broken)
```

### After (Clear):
```
Main Menu
├── Solo Play → Difficulty Screen
│   ├── Easy
│   ├── Normal
│   ├── Hard
│   └── Nightmare ✅
├── Daily Challenge
├── Tutorial
├── Squads
└── Leaderboards
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Clearer Navigation**
- Separates game modes from difficulty selection
- Users understand they need to choose a mode first
- Difficulty is a sub-choice within Solo Play

### 2. **Better Visual Hierarchy**
- Primary action (Solo Play) is prominent
- Secondary actions (Squads, Leaderboards) are smaller
- Info button (How to Play) is subtle

### 3. **Improved UX**
- Less overwhelming for new players
- Logical flow: Mode → Difficulty → Play
- Easy to find what you're looking for

### 4. **Scalability**
- Easy to add more game modes
- Easy to add more difficulties
- Clean separation of concerns

### 5. **Mobile-Friendly**
- Responsive grid layouts
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Adapts to screen size

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
const [view, setView] = useState('main');

// Show difficulty screen
if (view === 'difficulty') {
  return <DifficultySelect ... />;
}

// Show main menu
return <StartScreen ... />;
```

### Navigation Flow
```javascript
// Main Menu → Difficulty Screen
<button onClick={() => setView('difficulty')}>
  Solo Play
</button>

// Difficulty Screen → Start Game
<DifficultySelect
  onSelectDifficulty={(diff) => {
    setView('main');
    onStartGame(diff);
  }}
  onBack={() => setView('main')}
/>
```
