## OPENING: The Problem (0:00 - 0:20)


**Script:**
"Games treat Reddit as a marketing platform - drop a link, hope for upvotes, move on. But Reddit already has everything you need for real community competition: subreddits with distinct identities, natural rivalry and built-in discussions."

**[Transition to game title screen]**

"What if your subreddit membership actually mattered? What if r/gaming competing against r/indiegaming meant something real?"




## CORE GAMEPLAY (0:20 - 0:40)

**[Screen: Quick gameplay demonstration]**

**Script:**
"Stack Shooter is a survival shooter where you defend against vampire waves. Four difficulty modes, six upgrade paths, wave-based progression. But that's just the foundation."


## THE INNOVATION: Community Architecture (0:40 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Start screen showing community stats]**

**Script:**
"Here's what makes this different. Every player can join a squad - basically a clan within their subreddit. Your individual score adds to your squad's total. Your squad contributes to your subreddit's ranking."

**[Screen: Click through all 4 leaderboard tabs]**

"Four leaderboard types because different players care about different competitions. Global rankings for worldwide competition. Subreddit-specific leaderboards - so r/gaming can compete against r/vampires. Daily leaderboards that reset every 24 hours. Weekly rankings for consistent performance."

**[Screen: Show Daily Challenge]**

"Daily challenges apply the same modifiers to everyone. Today might be 'Speed Demons' where everything moves twice as fast. Eight challenge types rotate to keep it fresh. Everyone faces the same challenge, creating shared experiences to discuss in comments."

**[Screen: Show Squad Manager]**

"And the squad system turns individual play into team competition. Create or join a squad, and your scores combine. Now it's not just you versus everyone - it's your squad versus other squads, your subreddit versus other subreddits."



## THE TECHNICAL INSIGHT: Async Multiplayer (1:30 - 1:50)

**[Screen: Back to start screen or show mobile view if possible]**

**Script:**
"The entire system is asynchronous. No servers to maintain, no lag, no battery drain, no coordination required. You play when you want, your score still matters to your community. Works perfectly on mobile where most Reddit users browse."

**[Screen: Show responsive design or mention it]**

"I spent 60+ hours building this deliberately. Not rushing, but understanding every architectural decision. Mobile-first design, type-safe architecture, responsive layouts that adapt to Devvit's specific modes."

**Visual Actions:**
- Show the game working smoothly
- If possible, show mobile view
- Show clean UI at different sizes

**Key Point:** Emphasize the thoughtful technical decisions, not just "I built it fast."



## THE KIRO STORY: Learning and Automation (1:50 - 2:35)

**[Screen: Show code editor OR show .kiro directory]**

**Script:**
"Throughout development, I used Kiro conversationally - discussing problems, talking through approaches, debugging together. But here's where it gets interesting."

**[Screen: Show .kiro/hooks directory or mention it]**

"I created custom automation. An auto-commit hook that analyzes changes and generates natural commit messages - kept me in flow during those 60+ hour sessions. It's in my .kiro/hooks directory along with other helpful defaults."

**[Screen: Show project structure or documentation]**

"The result? A codebase I understand completely. Modular components, shared types for safety, clear separation of concerns. When I need to add features or fix bugs, I know exactly where to look."

**[Screen: Show phase documentation or mention it]**

"I documented the journey in phases - PHASE1, PHASE2, PHASE3 - showing what was built and why. Not just code, but understanding."



## THE IMPACT: Real Community Engagement (2:35 - 2:50)

**[Screen: Back to game, showing community features]**

**Script:**
"This creates behavior I didn't explicitly design. Squads form informal tournaments. Subreddits coordinate challenge attempts. Players actually care when their community moves up the rankings."

**[Screen: Show leaderboards one more time]**

"I built infrastructure. The community builds culture on top of it. That's what happens when you design for how people actually use Reddit - short sessions throughout the day, on mobile, as part of communities with distinct identities."

## CLOSING: The Vision (2:50 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Game title screen with community stats visible]**

**Script:**
"Stack Shooter isn't just hosted on Reddit - it's designed for Reddit's community structure. 60+ hours of deliberate development, thoughtful use of Kiro, and a foundation ready to grow with its community."
