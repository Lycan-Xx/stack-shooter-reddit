# Critical Multiplayer Fixes - Root Cause Analysis

## Issue 1: Bullets Not Firing ðŸ”´ CRITICAL

### Root Cause
The server `/api/match/shoot` endpoint adds bullets to the game engine, BUT the game engine state is NOT being persisted back to Redis properly, OR the bullets array is being overwritten.

### The Flow (What Should Happen)
1. Client calls `sendShoot()` â†’ POST `/api/match/shoot`
2. Server creates GameEngine with current match state
3. Server calls `engine.addBullet()`
4. Server saves updated state to Redis
5. Client calls `/api/match/state` â†’ gets bullets
6. Client renders bullets

### The Problem
Step 4 or 5 is failing. The bullets are added but not persisted or retrieved.

### Solution
- Fix the shoot endpoint to properly save state
- Ensure bullets persist between ticks
- Add logging to debug

## Issue 2: Position Flickering ðŸŸ  HIGH

### Root Cause
Client-side prediction reconciliation is fighting with server updates every frame.

### The Problem
```javascript
// This runs EVERY frame
if (positionDiff > 50) {
  player.x += (serverX - player.x) * 0.3; // Constant adjustment
}
```

### Solution
- Only reconcile when server position changes significantly
- Use timestamp to prevent constant reconciliation
- Increase reconciliation threshold

## Issue 3: 5-Minute Timer Not Working ðŸŸ  HIGH

### Root Cause
Timer is displayed but `timeRemaining` from match state is not being updated or is 0.

### The Problem
Server tick updates `timeRemaining`, but it may not be in the initial match state or not being synced.

### Solution
- Ensure match has `timeRemaining` when started
- Verify server tick updates it
- Check client receives it

## Issue 4: Pause Menu Missing Exit Button ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM

### Current State
Pause menu only has "Resume" and "Main Menu"

### Solution
- "Main Menu" should show stats before exiting
- Add stats modal on exit

---

## Issue 5: Solo Stats Should Be Separate Page ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM

### Current State
Stats shown inline in Game Over screen

### Solution
- Create separate Stats modal/screen
- Add "View Stats" button
- Keep it accessible from Game Over

## Issue 6: Remove Player Collision âœ… ALREADY DONE

Players already pass through each other - no collision detection exists.

---

## Implementation Priority

1. ðŸ”´ Fix bullets not firing (game-breaking)
2. ðŸŸ  Fix position flickering (playability)
3. ðŸŸ  Fix timer not working (core feature)
4. ðŸŸ¡ Improve pause menu (UX)
5. ðŸŸ¡ Separate stats page (UX)
