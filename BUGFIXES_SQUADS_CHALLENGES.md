# Bug Fixes: Squads & Daily Challenges

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Daily Challenge Gameplay Freeze âœ…
**Problem**: Game would freeze when killing the last enemy in a wave during challenge mode.

**Root Cause**: The wave completion logic tried to access `DIFFICULTY[game.difficulty]` but when `game.difficulty === 'challenge'`, that key doesn't exist in the DIFFICULTY object, causing an undefined reference error.

**Fix**: Added fallback to use `DIFFICULTY.normal` when in challenge mode:
```javascript
// Before (caused crash)
const bonus = 50 * DIFFICULTY[game.difficulty].scoreMultiplier;

// After (works correctly)
const diff = game.difficulty === 'challenge' ? DIFFICULTY.normal : DIFFICULTY[game.difficulty];
const bonus = 50 * diff.scoreMultiplier;
```

**File**: `src/client/hooks/useGameLoop.js` (line ~694)

### 2. Squad Creation Failing âœ…
**Problem**: Squad creation would fail silently without creating the squad or showing proper error messages.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Missing try-catch error handling
2. Duplicate return statement causing syntax errors
3. No input validation for empty strings
4. Using deprecated `.substr()` method

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Added Input Validation**:
```typescript
if (!name || name.trim().length === 0) {
  return { success: false, error: 'Squad name is required' };
}

if (!tag || tag.trim().length === 0) {
  return { success: false, error: 'Squad tag is required' };
}
```

2. **Added Try-Catch Error Handling**:
```typescript
try {
  // Squad creation logic
  console.log(`Creating squad: ${JSON.stringify(squad)}`);
  // ... save operations
  console.log(`Squad created successfully: ${squadId}`);
  return { success: true, squad };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error creating squad:', error);
  return { success: false, error: 'Failed to create squad. Please try again.' };
}
```

3. **Fixed Deprecated Method**:
```typescript
// Before
const squadId = `squad_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;

// After
const squadId = `squad_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 11)}`;
```

4. **Added Data Sanitization**:
```typescript
const squad: Squad = {
  id: squadId,
  name: name.trim(),
  tag: tag.trim().toUpperCase(),
  // ...
};
```

5. **Removed Duplicate Return Statement**: Removed extra `return { success: true, squad };` that was outside the try-catch block.

**File**: `src/server/core/squads.ts` (createSquad method)

## How Squad System Works (Production Ready)

### **User Flow**:

1. **Access Squads**
   - Click "ðŸ‘¥ Squads" button on main menu
   - Opens Squad Manager modal

2. **Create Squad**
   - Click "Create Squad"
   - Enter squad name (any text, max 30 chars)
   - Enter squad tag (3-4 uppercase letters, e.g., "VAMP", "HUNT")
   - Click "Create Squad"
   - Squad is created and user becomes the creator

3. **View Squad**
   - See squad info card with tag, name, and stats
   - View all squad members sorted by contribution
   - Creator has crown icon (ðŸ‘‘)
   - See total squad score, kills, and member count

4. **Play Games**
   - Every game played automatically adds score to squad
   - Score submission happens in `/api/score/submit` endpoint
   - Calls `SquadService.addSquadScore()` automatically
   - No extra action needed from player

5. **Squad Leaderboard**
   - Click "Leaderboard" tab in Squad Manager
   - See top 10 squads ranked by total score
   - Shows squad tag, name, member count, and total score
   - Updates in real-time as games are played

6. **Leave Squad**
   - Click "Leave Squad" button
   - Confirm action
   - User removed from squad
   - If last member, squad is deleted
   - If creator leaves, first member becomes new creator

### **Technical Flow**:

```
Player plays game â†’ Game ends â†’ Score submitted
    â†“
/api/score/submit endpoint
    â†“
LeaderboardService.saveMatchResult() (personal leaderboard)
    â†“
SquadService.addSquadScore() (squad leaderboard)
    â†“
Updates:
  - Squad total score
  - Squad total kills
  - Squad total wins
  - Member contribution stats
  - Squad leaderboard ranking
```

### **Data Storage (Redis)**:

```
squad:{squadId} - Squad data (JSON)
squad:tag:{TAG} - Tag to squad ID mapping
user:{username}:squad - User to squad ID mapping
squads:leaderboard - Sorted set of squad IDs by score
squad:{squadId}:member:{username} - Member stats (hash)
```

### **Features**:

âœ… Create squads with custom names and tags
âœ… Automatic score aggregation
âœ… Squad leaderboard (top 10)
âœ… Member contribution tracking
âœ… Leave squad functionality
âœ… Creator designation
âœ… Squad deletion when empty
âœ… Tag uniqueness validation
âœ… Member limit (10 players)
âœ… Real-time updates

### **Future Enhancements** (Not Implemented):

- Invite system (currently manual)
- Squad chat/messaging
- Squad challenges
- Squad achievements
- Squad customization (colors, icons)
- Kick members (creator only)
- Transfer creator role
