# üé• Stack Shooter: Vampire Siege - Final Video Script

## 3-Minute Demo for Reddit x Kiro Hackathon

---

## OPENING: The Problem (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Screen: Show Reddit with gaming posts OR just start with your game]**

**Script:**
"Most games just post on Reddit and hope for upvotes. But what if your subreddit actually mattered? What if r/gaming could compete against r/indiegaming for real?"

**[Show game title screen]**

"That's what I built."

**Visual Actions:**

- Show Stack Shooter start screen
- Show game title clearly

---

## CORE GAMEPLAY (0:20 - 0:40)

**[Screen: Quick gameplay]**

**Script:**
"Stack Shooter is a vampire survival game. You fight waves, unlock upgrades, and try to survive as long as possible. Pretty standard stuff."

**[Show upgrade screen]**

"But the real game happens outside your individual session."

**Visual Actions:**

- Start a game
- Show 10-15 seconds of shooting vampires

## THE INNOVATION: Community Features (0:40 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Start screen with community stats]**

**Script:**
"Here's what makes this different. Your score doesn't just go on a leaderboard - it goes to your squad, and your squad represents your subreddit."

**[Screen: Click through leaderboards]**

"Four different leaderboards. Global - compete with everyone. Subreddit - r/gaming versus r/vampires. Daily - resets every 24 hours. Weekly - for consistent players."

**[Screen: Show Daily Challenge]**

"Daily challenges give everyone the same modifiers. Today might be 'Speed Demons' - everything moves twice as fast. Tomorrow it's different. Everyone plays the same challenge, so you can talk about it in the comments."

**[Screen: Show Squad Manager]**

"Squads let you team up. Your scores combine. Now it's not just you versus everyone - it's your squad versus other squads."

**Visual Actions:**

- Show community stats at bottom
- Click through ALL 4 leaderboard tabs
- Pause on subreddit leaderboard
- Show daily challenge with modifier
- Show squad creation screen
- Show squad leaderboard

**Key Point:** This is your best feature - take your time here.

## THE TECHNICAL PART: How It Works (1:30 - 1:50)

**[Screen: Back to start screen]**

**Script:**
"Everything is async. No lag, no servers, no battery drain. You play whenever you want, and your score still counts for your community. Perfect for mobile, where most Reddit users are."

**[Screen: Show game running smoothly]**

"I spent 60+ hours building this. Not rushing - actually understanding how everything works. Mobile-first, clean code, works on all screen sizes."

**Visual Actions:**

- Show the game running smoothly
- Show it looks good on different sizes if possible
- Show clean interface

**Key Point:** You built this carefully, not quickly.

---

## THE KIRO PART: How I Built It (1:50 - 2:35)

**[Screen: Show code editor OR .kiro folder]**

**Script:**
"I used Kiro throughout development. Not just to generate code - to talk through problems, discuss solutions, debug issues."

**[Screen: Show .kiro/hooks folder]**

"I made custom tools. Like this auto-commit hook - it writes my commit messages for me. Kept me focused during those 60+ hour sessions."

**[Screen: Show project folders]**

"The result? I understand every part of this code. Clean folders, organized files. When I need to fix something, I know exactly where it is."

**[Screen: Show PHASE documents]**

"I documented everything in phases. PHASE1, PHASE2, PHASE3. Not just what I built, but why I built it that way."

**Visual Actions:**

- Show .kiro folder
- Show auto-commit-message.kiro.hook file
- Show project structure (src/client, src/server, src/shared)
- Show one PHASE_COMPLETE.md file
- Show organized code

**Key Point:** You used Kiro as a partner, not just a code writer.

---

## THE IMPACT: What Happens (2:35 - 2:50)

**[Screen: Back to game]**

**Script:**
"This creates things I didn't plan for. Squads start tournaments. Subreddits coordinate on challenges. People actually care when their community moves up."

**[Screen: Show leaderboards again]**

"I built the tools. The community builds the culture. That's what happens when you design for how Reddit actually works."

**Visual Actions:**

- Show community stats
- Show subreddit leaderboard
- Show squad system
- End with start screen

## CLOSING: Wrap Up (2:50 - 3:00)

**[Screen: Fade out]**

**Visual Actions:**

- Show start screen
- Show community stats
- Fade to black
