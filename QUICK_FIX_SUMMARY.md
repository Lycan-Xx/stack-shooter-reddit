# Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ⏱️ Timer Synchronization
**Problem:** Players entered game at different times
**Solution:** Server timestamp ensures everyone sees same countdown

**Before:**
```
Player 1: 15 → 14 → 13 → 12 → START
Player 2:      15 → 14 → 13 → 12 → START (3s late!)
```

**After:**
```
Player 1: 15 → 14 → 13 → 12 → START
Player 2:      12 → 11 → 10 → 9  → START (same time!)
```

### 2. 🖼️ Image Loading
**Problem:** External images blocked by Reddit CSP
**Solution:** Automatic fallback to canvas-generated sprites

**Before:**
```
[Broken Image] ← Vampire
[Broken Image] ← Player
```

**After:**
```
🔴 ← Red circle with fangs (Vampire)
🔵 ← Blue circle with arrow (Player)
```

## How to Test
